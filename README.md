# VHDLLab
Educational software for modelling and simulation of digital circuits.

## Summary
VHDLLab is a web based IDE for [VHDL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vhdl). It's
designed for educational purpose as an alternative to commercial products that
provide solution for VHDL.

## Rationale
The need for VHDLLab appeared at Faculty of Electrical Engineering and
Computing, University of Zagreb, Croatia where VHDL was taught in *Digital
Electronics* course. At the time (2006), [WebISE](http://www.xilinx.com) was
used by students for VHDL programming. However, WebISE had a couple of problems
when used for educational purposes. One of the big ones was licensing that
forbade universities from distributing WebISE to students for work at home.
Other problems included: inability to describe circuits as automatons, lots of
unnecessary features that distracts students, lots of bugs, huge footprint, etc.
VHDLLab was designed as a lightweight alternative to fix those problems as well
as add a few other niceties.

## Tried & Tested
VHDLLab is being used at Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing,
University of Zagreb, Croatia in *Digital Electronics* course since 2007. Every
year approximately 700 students use it to complete programming assignments.
