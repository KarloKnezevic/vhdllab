0) Who should read this
This documentation will try to elaborate how vhdllab is organized and how to
build vhdllab from source. If you simply wish to install vhdllab server then
read '2) Prerequisites' and INSTALL file instead.

1) Introduction
VHDLLab is a web based IDE for VHDL (programming language). It is designed for
educational purpose as an alternative for commercial products that provide
solutions for VHDL. The need for VHDLLab appeared at Faculty of Electrical
Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, Croatia when VHDL was taught
in Digital Electronics course. Originally WebISE was used by students when
programming VHDL code. But WebISE has many problems (huge footprint,
unnecessary features, inability to create automatons, lots of bugs, problems
with licence that disallows universities to distribute program, etc.). VHDLLab
was designed as a lightweight alternative to fix those problems.

VHDLLab has a client-server architecture. Client being a program where students
work to design digital components and server part that implements all necessary
features (code compilation & simulation, data storage, etc.). VHDLLab server is
a central server that is required for client to work! VHDLLab client can't work
as a standalone application (for example, as Eclipse IDE can). The reason for
this is to enable student to work at home, dorm or university without the need
to exchange files between computers. Other neat feature is that is simplifies
installation procedure for a student. In fact student just needs to start one
program (there is no installation at all!).

In the rest of the text a student will be referred to as a user (of VHDLLab
client application).

2) Prerequisites
In order to compile VHDLLab you will need the following:
    - Java JDK 6 (http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/)
    - Apache Ant 1.7 (http://ant.apache.org/)
    - Apache Tomcat 5 (http://tomcat.apache.org/)
    - MySQL (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/) - this can be changed to any
      other DBMS that hibernate (http://www.hibernate.org/) supports
      (basically any DBMS you want).

Make sure you install them correctly and update PATH environmental variable.
A user that runs VHDLLab client will only need Java JRE 6.

3) vhdllab-subprojects
By now you probably now that VHDLLab is divided into two projects: client and
server. But that's not all. Server is designed as a 3-tier architecture (bottom
to top): dao, service and presentation. So instead of designing VHDLLab as one
project it consists of several subprojects. All subdirectories that begin with
'vhdllab-' are subprojects of VHDLLab project. Also worth mentioning is that
all subprojects are Eclipse projects.

    vhdllab-entities - 
    vhdllab-dao - this is a dao tier of VHDLLab server. 
    vhdllab-service - 
    vhdllab-presentation - 
    vhdllab-client - 
    vhdllab-common - 
    vhdllab-misc -
